# 0x00. Pascal's Triangle

Pascal's Triangle is a fascinating mathematical structure that consists of an infinite triangular array of numbers. Each number in the triangle is obtained by summing the two numbers directly above it. The triangle is named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal, who introduced it in the 17th century, although it had been previously studied by mathematicians in India, Persia, and China.

The triangle starts with a single number, 1, at the top. Each subsequent row of the triangle is constructed by adding a 1 on both ends and calculating the values in between based on the rule of summing the two numbers above. This process generates a myriad of interesting patterns and properties.

Pascal's Triangle has many applications and is renowned for its numerous mathematical and combinatorial properties. It is widely used in various fields, including algebra, number theory, probability theory, and calculus. The triangle provides a convenient way to visualize binomial coefficients, powers of binomials, and the expansion of binomial expressions.

Not only is Pascal's Triangle a powerful mathematical tool, but it also holds significance in fields beyond mathematics. It has connections to various areas such as computer science, physics, and even art and design.

This repository contains a Python function, pascal_triangle(n), which generates Pascal's Triangle up to the nth row. It returns a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row of the triangle. The function handles cases where n is less than or equal to 0 by returning an empty list.

Feel free to explore Pascal's Triangle, experiment with the function, and discover its intriguing properties. Enjoy the journey into this captivating mathematical artifact!
